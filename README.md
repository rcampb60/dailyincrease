# dailyincrease
A simple script to determine the daily increase of COVID-19 cases in NHS Scotland for the previous 24 hours

The script relies on the user putting the Excel file from the Scottish Government's website into a location and updating the script to the location. 

The script otherwise can be left intact. 

My intention is to make the script more automatic through iteration to the point it will run automatically each day at 14:05 BST/GMT and download the file for the user.
